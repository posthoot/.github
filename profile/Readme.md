## Why Posthoot?

Modern email marketing platforms often lock you in, hide key details, and charge hefty fees for features you barely use. We built Posthoot to give you control‚Äîno more vendor lock-in, black-box algorithms, or surprise bills.

## üöÄ What Makes Posthoot Different?

- **Open Source & Transparent**: See and modify every part of the stack. No black boxes.
- **Multi-provider SMTP**: Connect SendGrid, Mailgun, SES, or any SMTP. Save money, get resilience, and never lose control if a provider fails.
- **Full Template Freedom**: Use your own HTML/CSS with powerful templating, A/B testing, mobile-first previews, and dynamic content.
- **Real AI (Not Marketing Hype)**: Our AI helps predict open rates, optimize content, segment audiences, and recommend send times, using *real* machine intelligence.
- **Smart Automation**: Build multi-step, trigger-driven campaigns that run themselves with goal tracking and performance optimization.
- **Developer-first Experience**: RESTful APIs, easy SDKs, real-time analytics, and full self-hosting support.
- **Enterprise Ready**: Security, scalability, compliance, uptime, and affordability without compromise.
